-----All About State Management-----

1. What is State Management ?
Explanation :-
* State management refers to the process of handling and maintaining the state or data of an application throughout its lifecycle.
* In frontend development, state typically represents the current condition or values of variables in an application.
* Effective state management is crucial for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
* In React and other frontend frameworks, there are various methods to manage state :-
    Local Component State -
        Each component in React can have its own local state managed using the `useState` hook.
        Local state is confined to the component it belongs to and is primarily used for managing component-specific data.
    Context API -
        React provides the Context API to manage global state that needs to be accessed by multiple components.
        It allows the sharing of state across the component tree without having to pass props manually through each level.
    State Management Libraries (e.g., Redux, Recoil) -
        Specialized state management libraries offer advanced features for handling complex global state in large applications.
        These libraries often introduce concepts like actions, reducers, and a centralized store for maintaining state.
    Recoil -
        Recoil is a state management library developed by Facebook specifically for React applications.
        It introduces the concept of atoms and selectors, providing a more flexible and scalable approach to managing and sharing state.
* Note -
    The choice of state management method depends on the complexity and requirements of the application.
    Effective state management enhances the predictability, maintainability, and scalability of the application, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
