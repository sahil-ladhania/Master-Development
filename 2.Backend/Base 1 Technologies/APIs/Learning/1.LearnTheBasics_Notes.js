-----Learn The Basics-----

1. What are APIs ?
Explanation :-
* API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
* Types - REST, SOAP, GraphQL, etc.
* Key Role - Enables functionality sharing without exposing the underlying code or structure.

2. What is HTTP ?
Explanation :-
* HyperText Transfer Protocol is the foundation of data communication on the web.
* Role - It defines how requests and responses are made over the internet.
* Stateless - Each request is independent and doesnâ€™t rely on previous requests.

3. What are HTTP Versions ?
Explanation :-
* HTTP/1.1 - Widely used; supports persistent connections.
* HTTP/2 - Faster, multiplexes requests to reduce load time.
* HTTP/3 - Uses QUIC protocol for even lower latency and improved speed.

4. What are HTTP Methods ?
Explanation :-
* GET - Retrieve data.
* POST - Submit data.
* PUT - Update data.
* PATCH - Partial update.
* DELETE - Remove data.

5. What are HTTP Status Codes ?
Explanation :-
* 1xx (Informational) - Processing (e.g., 100 Continue).
* 2xx (Success) - Request succeeded (e.g., 200 OK).
* 3xx (Redirection) - Redirect (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).
* 4xx (Client Error) - Bad request (e.g., 404 Not Found).
* 5xx (Server Error) - Server failed (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

6. What are HTTP Headers ?
Explanation :-
* Metadata for requests and responses in the form of key-value pairs.
* Ex -
	Content-Type: Format of data (e.g., JSON).
	Authorization: Token or credentials for authentication.

7. What are Cookies ?
Explanation :-
* Small pieces of data stored on the client side to maintain session states.
* Use - Tracking sessions, personalization, authentication.

8. What is CORS ?
Explanation :-
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allows restricted resources to be requested from another domain.
* Why - For security, browsers restrict cross-origin requests, and CORS provides controlled access.

9. What are HTTP Caching ?
Explanation :-
* A technique to store copies of resources for faster access.
* Benefits - Reduces server load and improves load times.
* Headers - Cache-Control, Expires.

10. What is URL, Query & Path Parameters ?
Explanation :-
* URL - Unique address to locate a resource.
* Query Parameters - ?key=value to filter data (after the ? symbol).
* Path Parameters - /resource/{id} used to identify specific resources.

11. What is Content Negotiation in API Design ?
Explanation :-
* Process where the client and server agree on the content format (e.g., JSON, XML).
* Header - Accept: application/json.

12. What is TCP / IP ?
Explanation :-
* Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is the foundational protocol suite for networking.
* Role - Ensures reliable data transmission over networks (error-checking, packet delivery).

13. What is the Basics of DNS ?
Explanation :-
* Domain Name System converts human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
* Role - Acts like a phonebook for the internet.
